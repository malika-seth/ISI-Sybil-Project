# USC-ISI-ML-Project

For the past one year, I have been working as a Data Science Research Assistant at Information Sciences Institute (ISI), under the guidance of Yolanda Gil and Fred Morstatter. 

My multidisciplinary project was in collaboration with the Cyprus-basing video-gaming company, Wargaming.net, and PhD students from USC’s School of Communication. It is here that I have had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of data mining concepts such as social network analysis and community detection to identify the social engagement between players. I leveraged the Python and R programming tools for this project.

I further went on to build a Random Forest machine learning classifier in Python, using the scikit-learn library, to detect and conduct behavioral analysis of sybil(fake) accounts. My multi-disciplinary team also published a paper about the same - “I’ll Play on My Smurf Account: Sybils and Network Measures" at the 70th Annual ICA Conference, Australia in May 2020.
